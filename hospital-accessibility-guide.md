# Hospital Accessibility Assessment Project Guide
## Quick Implementation for Bachelor's Term Project

### Project Overview
**Duration**: 3-4 weeks  
**Alignment**: Professor's research on emergency medical services and spatial accessibility  
**Tools**: QGIS (free), OpenStreetMap data, Delhi open datasets  
**Skills Required**: Basic GIS knowledge (can be learned in 2-3 days)

## Week-by-Week Implementation Plan

### Week 1: Data Collection and Setup
**Objective**: Gather all required spatial and demographic data

#### Data Sources (All Free):
1. **Hospital Locations**
   - Delhi Open Data Portal: https://data.gov.in/
   - OpenStreetMap hospitals in Delhi
   - Validate with Google Maps/Google Earth

2. **Road Network**
   - OpenStreetMap Delhi road network
   - Download using QGIS QuickOSM plugin
   - Focus on major roads and arterials

3. **Population Data**
   - Census 2011 ward-wise population
   - Delhi Statistical Handbook demographic data
   - Population density by administrative boundaries

#### Setup Tasks:
- Install QGIS (free download)
- Install plugins: QuickOSM, Network Analyst, TravelTime
- Create project folder structure
- Download and organize all datasets

### Week 2: Spatial Analysis Setup
**Objective**: Create service area analysis and accessibility maps

#### Key Analysis Steps:
1. **Network Analysis Preparation**
   - Clean road network data
   - Set travel speeds (walking: 1.2 m/s, vehicle: 40 km/h)
   - Define service area thresholds: 15, 30, 60 minutes

2. **Service Area Generation**
   - Use QGIS Network Analyst
   - Generate isochrone maps from each hospital
   - Create coverage polygons for multiple time thresholds

3. **Population Overlay**
   - Intersect service areas with population data
   - Calculate served vs. underserved populations
   - Identify accessibility gaps

### Week 3: Analysis and Mapping
**Objective**: Complete accessibility calculations and create final maps

#### Analysis Components:
1. **Accessibility Metrics**
   - Service Population Ratio (SPR) = served population / total population
   - Service Area Ratio (SAR) = served area / total area
   - Calculate for each district/ward

2. **Gap Analysis**
   - Identify areas >30 minutes from nearest hospital
   - Map underserved populations
   - Overlay with vulnerable demographics (elderly, low income)

3. **Visualization**
   - Create professional maps with proper symbology
   - Use color schemes for accessibility levels
   - Add scale bars, north arrows, legends

### Week 4: Documentation and Validation
**Objective**: Complete project documentation and validate results

#### Deliverables:
1. **Technical Report** (15-20 pages)
   - Introduction and literature review
   - Methodology description
   - Results and analysis
   - Recommendations for policy

2. **Maps and Visualizations**
   - Hospital accessibility coverage maps
   - Population accessibility ratio maps
   - Gap identification maps
   - Recommended new facility locations

3. **Presentation** (15-20 slides)
   - Problem statement
   - Methodology overview
   - Key findings
   - Policy recommendations

## Expected Outcomes

### Maps Produced
1. Hospital distribution map with road network
2. 15-minute accessibility coverage
3. 30-minute accessibility coverage  
4. 60-minute accessibility coverage
5. Population density vs. hospital accessibility
6. Underserved area identification
7. Recommended new facility locations

### Quantitative Results
- Percentage of population within 15/30/60 minutes of hospitals
- District-wise accessibility ratios
- Identification of 5-10 priority areas for new facilities
- Cost-benefit analysis of proposed interventions

### Research Contribution
